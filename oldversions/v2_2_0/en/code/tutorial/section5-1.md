# User Community

In this article, we will introduce the Project Sprint user community.

Project Sprint is an open method provided under a [CC BY-SA 4.0 license](https://projectsprint.org/LICENCE). The method is shaped by a group of volunteer users called **Project Sprint Contributors**, who repeatedly define and improve the method.

There are several ways for users to become proactively involved in Project Sprint as one of the contributors.
